1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,260
Our online school of landscape design will turn

2
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:05,980
three years old in the summer of 2022.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,680
We have been working with Alena and her

4
00:00:08,680 --> 00:00:10,860
team for nearly a year and a half.

5
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,020
They are the ones who create all our

6
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,980
landing pages and websites, which I associate with

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:18,420
the success of our school.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,820
Before starting work with RedSquirrel, at least

9
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,160
six people failed to meet our expectations.

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,260
My first work contact with the RedSquirrel

11
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,660
team impressed me with their systematic approach and

12
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:32,320
clear organization of labor.

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,160
Later, I was convinced that they had delved

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,800
so deeply into our subject matter that it

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,420
sometimes seemed as though the team members could

16
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,400
read my thoughts.

17
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:44,080
It is pleasing that today, in the frantic

18
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,920
pace of hustle and bustle, there are people

19
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,920
you can rely on to work through all

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,560
the details and find new solutions and algorithms

21
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,420
for improving and systematizing business.

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:58,720
Work is always on time, attention to detail,

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,660
strict adherence to specifications, nearly 24-hour

24
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,220
feedback, prompt responses, and keeping up with the

25
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:06,940
day's trends.

26
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,320
These qualities seem rare today.

27
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,100
That is exactly why I recommended the Red

28
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:15,280
Squirrel team to my daughter Olesya, who has

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:18,220
her own small business making women's jewelry.

30
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:21,440
I want to express my deep gratitude to

31
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:24,120
Alena and the RedSquirrel team for their

32
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,320
approach to clients and wish them success in

33
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,780
a very important aspect of any business - creating

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,360
the "face" of your enterprise and your recognizability.
