00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Our online School of Landscape design will turn three years old in the summer of 2022.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:11,000
We have been working with Alina and her team for nearly a year and a half.

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:18,000
They are the ones who create all our landing pages and websites, which I associate with the success of our school.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Before starting work with Red Squirrel, at least six people failed to meet our expectations.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,000
My first work contact with the Red Squirrel team impressed me with their systematic approach and clear organization of labor.

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Later, I was convinced that they had delved so deeply into our subject matter that it sometimes seemed as though the team members could read my thoughts.

7
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,000
It is pleasing that today in the frantic pace of hustle and bustle.

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:52,000
There are people you can rely on to work through all the details and find new solutions and algorithms

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
for improving and systematizing business.

10
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Work is always on time, attention to detail, strict adherence to specifications, nearly 24-hour feedback, prompt responses, and keeping up with the day's trends.

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
These qualities seem rare today.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:18,000
That is exactly why I recommended the Red Squirrel team to my daughter, Alessia, who has her own small business making women's jewelry.

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:34,000
I want to express my deep gratitude to Elena and the Red Squirrel team for their approach to clients and wish them success in a very important aspect of any business, creating the face of your enterprise and your recognizability.
