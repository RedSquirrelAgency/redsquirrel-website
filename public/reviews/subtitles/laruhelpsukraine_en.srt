00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:04,110
Our fruitful collaboration with Ekaterina and the RedSquirrel team

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:07,890
began when we needed to create a professional-looking and functional

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:13,930
website for the humanitarian organization laruhelpsukraine.com. After

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,530
discussing the mission and goals of the organization, they started

5
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:21,730
working on the site structure, preparing prototypes, and drawing the

6
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:26,470
design of the main and step-by-step next pages. After agreeing on the

7
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:30,150
design, they began working on layout and development in cooperation

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,930
with the programmers. Ekaterina supported the organization and

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:39,490
actively participated in its work for a long time, adapting flexibly

10
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:43,970
to changing goals and priorities. They effectively implemented the

11
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:48,150
necessary changes and improvements on the site and also provided

12
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:51,950
tangible assistance in training employees to work with the site.

13
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:56,310
Ekaterina and her team work in a very structured way, clearly

14
00:00:56,310 --> 00:01:00,450
pronounce priorities and independently coordinate the development and

15
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:05,130
implementation of the website within the agreed time frame. She asks

16
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:08,330
for feedback in a timely manner and provides the necessary

17
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,970
recommendations and support in making decisions. Ekaterina is a

18
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:16,530
pleasure to work with and she has excellent taste. We were completely

19
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:19,370
satisfied with the work performed by the RedSquirrel team.
