00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,490
Deciding to create my own website was difficult for some reasons.

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,210
Firstly, there was a very vivid negative experience several years ago

3
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:12,050
when we got something completely different from what we wanted and

4
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:16,370
for a very large sum of money. Secondly, I thought that if I really

5
00:00:16,370 --> 00:00:20,470
tried, I could build the website myself. But then the need for a

6
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:24,030
website outweighed all other doubts and fears, and we started working

7
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:28,330
with the RedSquirrel team. Ease of communication, full understanding

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:32,630
of the task, and clarity in work - that's exactly what I needed at the

9
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:36,810
first stage. Help in structuring all my "must-have" and "not necessary"

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:40,630
items, advice, and professional recommendations from the heads of the

11
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:44,430
team helped me clearly understand how the website would look after

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,770
just 1 day! It was nice that everything was done on time, without

13
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:53,090
reminders and postponements. And when, after a few days, I already

14
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:57,010
saw the first ready pages of the website...I must admit, I didn't even

15
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:01,230
believe it was my website! The online store was created very quickly -

16
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:05,430
that's awesome! Thank you for the work! For making the website

17
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:09,030
convenient and understandable for customers, for excellent

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:12,670
communication, and for turning the website development into a

19
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,710
pleasant pastime. Towards the end, it was even a little sad to part

20
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,710
ways :) When the work is awesome - it shows! You have it just like that!

21
00:01:22,230 --> 00:01:25,410
Once again, heartfelt thanks for the website and for the work!

22
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:28,090
Wishing you creative success and more clients!
